      <p>Hello, My name is Hardeep Singh and I am from Rajasthan <strong>(India)</strong>. I belong to a nuclear family and i am so blessed to have this family who stood by my side in every situation.My father is a Teacher who knows how to love his profession with passion and dedication. While my mother is a house wife. My elder brother is a technician who is also living in Canada, My sister is still studying and wants to be a good Teacher. From the start i am very passionate about exploring technology, so i have decided to study in Computer Science. I was born and brought up in rajasthan, but all of our relatives were in punjab (The homeland of the Sikh Religion), So i got the chance to learn  about the culture of the diffrent peoples of different states. It was my dream to study in Canada and to learn about the lifestyle of the people.</p>
